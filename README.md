# Misfires

This is a soccer lineup app enabling users to customize team formations, lineups and assign players to preferred positions. Features include managing player availability, adding substitutions as needed (based on position need or by overall team count), and jersey colour assignment.

## Build and Run locally

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. The next major goal is to build a backend database that will allow Misfires lineup data to be saved and edited. Planned frontend enhancements include adding forms to add, edit, or delete players from the lineup, as well as the potential to create and manage new teams.
